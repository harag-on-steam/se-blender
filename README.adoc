= SE Block Tools for Blender

Modelling blocks for http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/[Space Engineers] is a process that 
involves a lot of intermediary files and manual parametrization. 
This add-on simplifies the steps you need to take to get from a 3D mesh in Blender to 
Space Engineer's own `.mwm` mesh-format. To do that

. The add-on provides property panels for all the special data SE stores inside an `.mwm` file directly in Blender.
. You use Blender layers to define the main model, the collision model, mount-points, mirroring-settings,
  level-of-detail models and construction stages.
. The workflow that configures and runs the conversion-tools (Havok, MwmBuilder) for you is customizable
  to suite your needs.
